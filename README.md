# Nepali Badwords List

A collection of Nepali swear words and offensive terms — designed for Minecraft servers, chat filters, and any system needing Nepali content moderation.

## 📌 Why?

I run a Minecraft Server and want to prevent bad words in chat. Instead of keeping this private, I’m building this open-source project so others can benefit and contribute too.

## 📂 File Structure

Badwords are split into multiple files inside the `data/` folder:

- `badwords-1.txt`
- `badwords-2.txt`
- ...

Each file contains a list of bad words, one per line, in **Romanized Nepali or Devanagari**.

## ✍️ How to Contribute
