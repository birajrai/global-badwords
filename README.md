# 🌍 Global Badwords List

A collection of swear words and offensive terms from various countries — designed for Minecraft servers, chat filters, and any system needing multilingual content moderation.

## 📌 Why?

I run a Minecraft Server and want to prevent bad words in chat. Instead of keeping this private, I’m building this open-source project so others can benefit and contribute too. This list is open-source and community-driven.

## 📂 File Structure

Badwords are organized by country inside the `data/` folder:

- `data/nepal.txt` – Nepali (Romanized and Devanagari)
- `data/india.txt` – Hindi, regional Indian languages
- `data/usa.txt` – English (US)
- `data/spain.txt` – Spanish (Spain)
- `data/france.txt` – French
- ...

Each file contains a list of bad words, one per line, written in **plain UTF-8 text**.
