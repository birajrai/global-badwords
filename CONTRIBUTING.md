# Contributing to Nepali Badwords List

Thank you for wanting to help!

This project is for collecting Nepali bad words (in English letters) so we can block them on things like Minecraft servers and chat apps.

## ðŸ“¥ How to Add a Word

1. Go to the `data/` folder.
2. Open the file named `badwords-1.txt`.
3. Add your word to the end of the list.
4. Make sure:
   - One word per line
   - Only English (Romanized Nepali) spelling
   - No capital letters (use lowercase only)
   - The word is **actually bad** and used as an insult or swear

âœ… Example:

```txt
badword1
badword2
