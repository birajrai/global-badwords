# Contributing to the Global Badwords List

Thank you for wanting to help!

This project collects offensive words used in different countries and languages so we can block them in games, chat apps, websites, and more.

## ðŸ“¥ How to Add a Word

1. Go to the `data/` folder.
2. Choose the file for the country you want to add to, e.g. `data/nepal.txt` or `data/usa.txt`.
3. Add your word at the end of the file.
4. Follow these rules:
   - One word per line
   - Use lowercase (for Latin/Roman scripts)
   - Use the Romanized version if the word isnâ€™t in Latin script
   - Only include clearly offensive, insulting, or vulgar words

âœ… Example:

```txt
badword1
badword2
